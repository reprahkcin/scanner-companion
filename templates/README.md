# Templates

This directory contains template files that are copied to generated session directories.

## Files

- `SESSION_README.md` - Template README copied to each capture session directory
- `rename_xmp_for_rc.py` - Helper script copied to sessions for XMP file renaming

These files are automatically copied by the scanner software during capture sessions to make each session directory self-contained and portable.
